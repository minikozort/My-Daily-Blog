Title: 
My-Daily-Blog


Description:
In this challenge, I have created a landing page for my blog. In the landining page, I haved added a form to be submitted and a button to change from dark to light mode as desired.
I have created a second page of html where you can view your blog posts with the same functionality and an added "back" button to go to the main page.
Using local storage, I was able to save and retreive everything that can be view on the blog.html page that was previously added.

How to Run:
Simply go on to the website and fill out the form. If the form isn't filled out, you will be alerted to fill out the form above the submit button.
Once submitted, you can then view your submitted blog in the next page.
When you click on the top left toggle switch, you can set the webpage to dark color or go back to the original light color.
Enjoy Blogging.
